    <h1>Rikriti Koirala acts in a play</h1>
    <h3>The Master Builder by Henrik Ibsen</h3>

<h6>KNUT BROVIK.</h6>

<p>[Rises suddenly, as if in distress, from the table; breathes heavily and
laboriously as he comes forward into the doorway.] No, I can't bear it
much longer!</p>

<h6>KAIA.</h6>

<p>[Going up to him.] You are feeling very ill this evening, are you not,
Uncle?</p>


<h6>BROVIK.</h6>

<p>Oh, I seem to get worse every day.</p>


<h6>RAGNAR.</h6>

<p>[Has risen and advances.] You ought to go home, father. Try to get a
little sleep--</p>


<h6>BROVIK.</h6>

<p>[Impatiently.] Go to bed, I suppose? Would you have me stifled outright?</p>


<h6>KAIA.</h6>

<p>Then take a little walk.</p>


<h6>RAGNAR.</h6>

<p>Yes, do. I will come with you.</p>


<h6>BROVIK.</h6>

<p>[With warmth.] I will not go till he comes! I and determined to have
it out this evening with--[in a tone of suppressed bitterness]--with
him--with the chief.</p>


<h6>KAIA.</h6>

<p>[Anxiously.] Oh no, uncle,--do wait awhile before doing that!</p>


<h6>RAGNAR.</h6>

<p>Yes, better wait, father!</p>


<h6>BROVIK.</h6>

<p>[Draws is breath laboriously.] Ha--ha--! _I_ haven't much time for
waiting.</p>


<h6>KAIA.</h6>

<p>[Listening.] Hush! I hear him on the stairs.

     [All three go back to their work.  A short silence.</p>
