    <h1>Rikriti Koirala acts in a play</h1>
    <h3>The Master Builder by Henrik Ibsen</h3>

    <pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap">
        A plainly-furnished work-room in the house of HALVARD SOLNESS.
  Folding doors on the left lead out to the hall.  On the right
  is the door leading to the inner rooms of the house.  At the
  back is an open door into the draughtsmen's office.  In front,
  on the left, a desk with books, papers and writing materials.
  Further back than the folding door, a stove.  In the right-
  hand corner, a sofa, a table, and one or two chairs.  On the
  table a water-bottle and glass.  A smaller table, with a
  rocking-chair and arm-chair, in front on the right.  Lighted
  lamps, with shades, on the table in the draughtmen's office,
  on the table in the corner, and on the desk.

  In the draughtsmen's office sit KNUT BROVIK and his son RAGNAR,
  occupied with plans and calculations.  At the desk in the outer
  office stands KAIA FOSLI, writing in the ledger.  KNUT BROVICK
  is a spare old man with white hair and beard.  He wears a
  rather threadbare but well-brushed black coat, with spectacles,
  and a somewhat discoloured white neckcloth.  RAGNAR BROVIK is
  a well-dressed, light-haired man in his thirties, with a
  slight stoop.  KAIA FOSLI is a slightly built girl, a little
  over twenty, carefully dressed, and delicate-looking.  She has
  a green shade over her eyes.--All three go on working for some
  time in silence.


KNUT BROVIK.

[Rises suddenly, as if in distress, from the table; breathes heavily and
laboriously as he comes forward into the doorway.] No, I can't bear it
much longer!

KAIA.

[Going up to him.] You are feeling very ill this evening, are you not,
Uncle?


BROVIK.

Oh, I seem to get worse every day.


RAGNAR.

[Has risen and advances.] You ought to go home, father. Try to get a
little sleep--


BROVIK.

[Impatiently.] Go to bed, I suppose? Would you have me stifled outright?


KAIA.

Then take a little walk.


RAGNAR.

Yes, do. I will come with you.


BROVIK.

[With warmth.] I will not go till he comes! I and determined to have
it out this evening with--[in a tone of suppressed bitterness]--with
him--with the chief.


KAIA.

[Anxiously.] Oh no, uncle,--do wait awhile before doing that!


RAGNAR.

Yes, better wait, father!


BROVIK.

[Draws is breath laboriously.] Ha--ha--! _I_ haven't much time for
waiting.


KAIA.

[Listening.] Hush! I hear him on the stairs.

     [All three go back to their work.  A short silence.


  HALVARD SOLNESS comes in through the hall door.  He is a man no
  longer young, but healthy and vigorous, with close-cut curly
  hair, dark moustache and dark thick eyebrows.  He wears a
  greyish-green buttoned jacket with an upstanding collar and
  broad lapels.  On his head he wears a soft grey felt hat,
  and he has one or two light portfolios under his arm.


SOLNESS.

[Near the door, points towards the draughtsmen's office, and asks in a
whisper:] Are they gone?


KAIA.

[Softly, shaking her] No.

     [She takes the shade off her eyes.  SOLNESS crosses the room,
       throws his hat on a chair, places the portfolios on the table
       by the sofa, and approaches the desk again.  KAIA goes on
       writing without intermission, but seems nervous and uneasy.


SOLNESS.

[Aloud.] What is that you are entering, Miss Fosli?


KAIA.

[Starts.] Oh, it is only something that--


SOLNESS.

Let me look at it, Miss Fosli. [Bends over her, pretends to be looking
into the ledger, and whispers:] Kaia!


KAIA.

[Softly, still writing.] Well?


SOLNESS.

Why do you always take that shade off when I come?


KAIA.

[As before.] I look so ugly with it on.


SOLNESS.

[Smiling.] Then you don't like to look ugly, Kaia?


KAIA.

[Half glancing up at him.] Not for all the world. Not in your eyes.


SOLNESS.

[Strokes her hair gently.] Poor, poor little Kaia--


KAIA.

[Bending her head.] Hush--they can hear you!

     [SOLNESS strolls across the room to the right, turns and pauses
       at the door of the draughtsmen's office.


SOLNESS.

Has any one been here for me?


RAGNAR.

[Rising.] Yes, the young couple who want a villa built, out at
Lovstrand.


SOLNESS.

[Growling.] Oh, those two! They must wait. I am not quite clear about
the plans yet.


RAGNAR.

[Advancing, with some hesitation.] They were very anxious to have the
drawings at once.


SOLNESS.

[As before.] Yes, of course--so they all are.


BROVIK.

[Looks up.] They say they are longing so to get into a house of their
own.


SOLNESS.

Yes, yes--we know all that! And so they are content to take whatever
is offered them. They get a--a roof over their heads--an address--but
nothing to call a home. No thank you! In that case, let them apply to
somebody else. Tell them that, the next time they call.


BROVIK.

[Pushes his glasses up on to his forehead and looks in astonishment at
him.] To somebody else? Are you prepared to give up the commission?


SOLNESS.

[Impatiently.] Yes, yes, yes, devil take it! If that is to be the way of
it--. Rather that, than build away at random. [Vehemently.] Besides, I
know very little about these people as yet.


BROVIK.

The people are safe enough. Ragnar knows them. He is a friend of the
family.


SOLNESS.

Oh, safe--safe enough! That is not at all what I mean. Good lord--don't
you understand me either? [Angrily.] I won't have anything to do with
these strangers. They may apply to whom they please, so far as I am
concerned.


BROVIK.

[Rising.] Do you really mean that?


SOLNESS.

[Sulkily.] Yes I do.--For once in a way. [He comes forward.

     [BROVIK exchanges a glance with RAGNAR, who makes a warning
       gesture.  Then BROVIK comes into the front room.


BROVIK.

May I have a few words with you?


SOLNESS.

Certainly.


BROVIK.

[To KAIA.] Just go in there for moment, Kaia.


KAIA.

[Uneasily.] Oh, but uncle--


BROVIK.

Do as I say, child. And shut the door after you.

     [KAIA goes reluctantly into the draughtsmen's office, glances
       anxiously and imploringly at SOLNESS, and shuts the door.


BROVIK.

[Lowering his voice a little.] I don't want the poor children to know
how I am.


SOLNESS.

Yes, you have been looking very poorly of late.


BROVIK.

It will soon be all over with me. My strength is ebbing--from day to
day.


SOLNESS.

Won't you sit down?


BROVIK.

Thanks--may I?


SOLNESS.

[Placing the arm-chair more conveniently.] Here--take this chair.--And
now?


BROVIK.

[Has seated himself with difficulty.] Well, you see, it's about Ragnar.
That is what weighs most upon me. What is to become of him?


SOLNESS.

Of course your son will stay with me as long as ever he likes.


BROVIK.

But that is just what he does not like. He feels that he cannot stay
here any longer.


SOLNESS.

Why, I should say he was very well off here. But if he wants more money,
I should not mind--


BROVIK.

No, no! It is not that. [Impatiently.] But sooner or later he, too, must
have a chance of doing something on his own account.


SOLNESS.

[Without looking at him.] Do you think that Ragnar has quite talent
enough to stand alone?


BROVIK.

No, that is just the heartbreaking part of it--I have begun to have
my doubts about the boy. For you have never said so much as--as one
encouraging word about him. And yet I cannot but think there must be
something in him--he can't be without talent.


SOLNESS.

Well, but he has learnt nothing--nothing thoroughly, I mean. Except, of
course, to draw.


BROVIK.

[Looks at him with covert hatred, and says hoarsely.] You had learned
little enough of the business when you were in my employment. But
that did not prevent you from setting to work--[breathing with
difficulty]--and pushing your way up, and taking the wind out of my
sails--mine, and so may other people's.


SOLNESS.

Yes, you see--circumstances favoured me.


BROVIK.

You are right there. Everything favoured you. But then how can you have
the heart to let me go to my grave--without having seen what Ragnar is
fit for? And of course I am anxious to see them married, too--before I
go.


SOLNESS.

[Sharply.] Is it she who wishes it?


BROVIK.

Not Kaia so much as Ragnar--he talks about it every day. [Appealingly.]
You must help him to get some independent work now! I must see something
that the lad has done. Do you hear?


SOLNESS.

[Peevishly.] Hang it, man, you can't expect me to drag commissions down
from the moon for him!


BROVIK.

He has the chance of a capital commission at this very moment. A big bit
of work.


SOLNESS.

[Uneasily, startled.] Has he?


BROVIK.

I you would give your consent.


SOLNESS.

What sort of work do you mean?


BROVIK.

[With some hesitation.] He can have the building of that villa out at
Lovstrand.


SOLNESS.

That! Why I am going to build that myself.


BROVIK.

Oh you don't much care about doing it.


SOLNESS.

[Flaring up.] Don't care! Who dares to say that?


BROVIK.

You said so yourself just now.


SOLNESS.

Oh, never mind what I say.--Would they give Ragnar the building of that
villa?


BROVIK.

Yes. You see, he knows the family. And then--just for the fun of the
thing--he has made drawings and estimates and so forth--


SOLNESS.

Are they pleased with the drawings? The people who will have to live in
the house?


BROVIK.

Yes. If you would only look through them and approve of them--


SOLNESS.

Then they would let Ragnar build their home for them?


BROVIK.

They were immensely pleased with his idea. They thought it exceedingly
original, they said.


SOLNESS.

Oho! Original! Not the old-fashioned stuff that _I_ am in the habit of
turning out!


BROVIK.

It seemed to them different.


SOLNESS.

[With suppressed irritation.] So it was to see Ragnar that they came
here--whilst I was out!


BROVIK.

They came to call upon you--and at the same time to ask whether you
would mind retiring--


SOLNESS.

[Angrily.] Retire? I?


BROVIK.

In case you thought that Ragnar's drawings--


SOLNESS.

I! Retire in favour of your son!


BROVIK.

Retire from the agreement, they meant.


SOLNESS.

Oh, it comes to the same thing. [Laughs angrily.] So that is it, is it?
Halvard Solness is to see about retiring now! To make room for younger
men! For the very youngest, perhaps! He must make room! Room! Room!


BROVIK.

Why, good heavens! there is surely room for more than one single man--


SOLNESS.

Oh, there's not so very much room to spare either. But, be that as it
may--I will never retire! I will never give way to anybody! Never of my
own free will. Never in this world will I do that!


BROVIK.

[Rise with difficulty.] Then I am to pass out of life without any
certainty? Without a gleam of happiness? Without any faith or trust in
Ragnar? Without having seen a single piece of work of his doing? Is that
to be the way of it?


SOLNESS.

[Turns half aside, and mutters.] H'm--don't ask more just now.


BROVIK.

I must have an answer to this one question. Am I to pass out of life in
such utter poverty?


SOLNESS.

[Seems to struggle with himself; finally he says, in a low but firm
voice:] You must pass out of life as best you can.


BROVIK.

Then be it so. [He goes up the room.


SOLNESS.

[Following him, half is desperation.] Don't you understand that I cannot
help it? I am what I am, and I cannot change my nature!


BROVIK.

No; I suppose that you can't. [Reels and supports himself against the
sofa-table.] May I have a glass of water?


SOLNESS.

By all means. [Fills a glass and hands it to him.


BROVIK.

Thanks. [Drinks and puts the glass down again.

     [SOLNESS goes up and opens the door of the draughtsmen's office.


SOLNESS.

Ragnar--you must come and take your father home.


  Ragnar rises quickly.  He and KAIA come into the work-room.


RAGNAR.

What is the matter, father?


BROVIK.

Give me your arm. Now let us go.


RAGNAR.

Very well. You had better put your things on, too, Kaia.


SOLNESS.

Miss Fosli must stay--just for a moment. There is a letter I want
written.


BROVIK.

[Looks at SOLNESS.] Good night. Sleep well--if you can.


SOLNESS.

Good night.

     [BROVIK and RAGNAR go out by the hall-door.  KAIA goes to the
       desk.  SOLNESS stands with bent head, to the right, by the
       arm-chair.


KAIA.

[Dubiously.] Is there any letter?


SOLNESS.

[Curtly.] No, of course not. [Looks sternly at her.] Kaia!


KAIA.

[Anxiously, in a low voice.] Yes!


SOLNESS.

[Points imperatively to a spot on the floor.] Come here! At once!


KAIA.

[Hesitatingly.] Yes.


SOLNESS.

[As before.] Nearer!


KAIA.

[Obeying.] What do you want with me?


SOLNESS.

[Looks at her for a while.] Is it you I have to thank for all this?


KAIA.

No, no, don't think that!


SOLNESS.

But confess now--you want to get married!


KAIA.

[Softly.] Ragnar and I have been engaged for four or five years, and
so--


SOLNESS.

And so you think it time there were an end of it. Is not that so?


KAIA.

Ragnar and Uncle say I must. So I suppose I shall have to give in.


SOLNESS.

[More gently.] Kaia, don't you really care a little bit for Ragnar, too?


KAIA.

I cared very much for Ragnar once--before I came here to you.


SOLNESS.

But you don't now? Not in the least?


KAIA.

[Passionately, clasping hands and holding them out towards him.] Oh, you
know very well there is only one person I care for now! I shall never
care for any one else.


SOLNESS.

Yes, you say that. And yet you go away from me--leave me alone here with
everything on my hands.


KAIA.

But could I not stay with you, even if Ragnar--?


SOLNESS.

[Repudiating the idea.] No, no, that is quite impossible. If Ragnar
leaves me and starts work on his own account, then of course he will
need you himself.


KAIA.

[Wringing her hands.] Oh, I feel as if I could not be separated from
you! It's quite, quite impossible!


SOLNESS.

Then be sure you get those foolish notions out of Ragnar's head. Marry
him as much as you please--[Alters his tone.] I mean--don't let him
throw up his good situation with me. For then I can keep you too, my
dear Kaia.


KAIA.

Oh yes, how lovely that would be, if it could only be managed!


SOLNESS.

[Clasps her head with his two hands and whispers.] For I cannot get on
without you, you see. I must have you with me every single day.


KAIA.

[In nervous exaltation.] My God! My God!


SOLNESS.

[Kisses her hair.] Kaia--Kaia!


KAIA.

[Sinks down before him.] Oh, how good you are to me! How unspeakably
good you are!


SOLNESS.

[Vehemently.] Get up! For goodness' sake get up! I think I hear some
one.

     [He helps her to rise.  She staggers over to the desk.


  MRS. SOLNESS enters by the door on the right.  She looks thin
  and wasted with grief, but shows traces of bygone beauty.
  Blonde ringlets.  Dressed with good taste, wholly in black.
  Speaks some-what slowly and in a plaintive voice.


MRS. SOLNESS.

[In the doorway.] Halvard!


SOLNESS.

[Turns.] Oh, are you there, my dear--?


MRS. SOLNESS.

[With a glance at KAIA.] I am afraid I am disturbing you.


SOLNESS.

Not in the least. Miss Fosli has only a short letter to write.


MRS. SOLNESS.

Yes, so I see.


SOLNESS.

What do you want with me, Aline?


MRS. SOLNESS.

I merely wanted to tell you that Dr. Herdal is in the drawing-room.
Won't you come and see him, Halvard?


SOLNESS.

[Looks suspiciously at her.]. H'm--is the doctor so very anxious to see
me?


MRS. SOLNESS.

Well, not exactly anxious. He really came to see me; but he would like
to say how-do-you-do to you at the same time.


SOLNESS.

[Laughs to himself.] Yes, I daresay. Well, you must ask him to wait a
little.


MRS. SOLNESS.

Then you will come in presently?


SOLNESS.

Perhaps I will. Presently, presently, dear. In a little while.


MRS. SOLNESS.

[Glancing again at KAIA.] Well now, don't forget, Halvard.

     [Withdraws and closes the door behind her.


KAIA.

[Softly.] Oh dear, oh dear--I am sure Mrs. Solness thinks ill of me in
some way!


SOLNESS.

Oh, not in the least. Not more than usual at any rate. But all the same,
you had better go now, Kaia.


KAIA.

Yes, yes, now I must go.


SOLNESS.

[Severely.] And mind you get that matter settled for me. Do you hear?


KAIA.

Oh, if it only depended on me--


SOLNESS.

I will have it settled, I say! And to-morrow too--not a day later!


KAIA.

[Terrified.] If there's nothing else for it, I am quite willing to break
off the engagement.


SOLNESS.

[Angrily.] Break it off. Are you mad? Would you think of breaking it
off?


KAIA.

[Distracted.] Yes, if necessary. For I must--I must stay here with you!
I can't leave you! That is utterly--utterly impossible!


SOLNESS.

[With a sudden outburst.] But deuce take it--how about Ragnar then! It's
Ragnar that I--


KAIA.

[Looks at him with terrified eyes.] It is chiefly on Ragnar's account,
that--that you--?


SOLNESS.

[Collecting himself.] No, no, of course not! You don't understand me
either. [Gently and softly.] Of course it is you I want to keep.--you
above everything, Kaia. But for that very reason, you must prevent
Ragnar, too, from throwing up his situation. There, there,--now go home.


KAIA.

Yes, yes--good-night, then.


SOLNESS.

Good night. [As she is going.] Oh, stop a moment! Are Ragnar's drawings
in there?


KAIA.

I did not see him take them with him.


SOLNESS.

Then just go and find them for me. I might perhaps glance over them,
after all.


KAIA.

[Happy.] Oh yes, please do!


SOLNESS.

For your sake, Kaia dear. Now, let me have them at once, please.

     [KAIA hurries into the draughtsmen's office, searches anxiously
       in the table-drawer, finds a portfolio and brings it with her.


KAIA.

Here are all the drawings.


SOLNESS.

Good. Put them down there on the table.


KAIA.

[Putting down the portfolio.] Good night, then. [Beseechingly.] And
please, please think kindly of me.


SOLNESS.

Oh, that I always do. Good-night, my dear little Kaia. [Glances to the
right.] Go, go now!


  MRS. SOLNESS and DR. HERDAL enter by the door on the right.
  He is a stoutish, elderly man, with a round, good-humoured
  face, clean shaven, with thin, light hair, and gold spectacles.


MRS. SOLNESS.

[Still in the doorway.] Halvard, I cannot keep the doctor any longer.


SOLNESS.

Well then, come in here.


MRS. SOLNESS.

[To KAIA, who is turning down the desk-lamp.] Have you finished the
letter already, Miss Fosli?


KAIA.

[In confusion.] The letter--?


SOLNESS.

Yes, it was quite a short one.


MRS. SOLNESS.

It must have been very short.


SOLNESS.

You may go now, Miss Fosli. And please come in good time to-morrow
morning.


KAIA.

I will be sure to. Good-night, Mrs. Solness.

     [She goes out by the hall door.


SOLNESS.

Are you in a hurry, doctor?


DR. HERDAL.

No, not at all.
